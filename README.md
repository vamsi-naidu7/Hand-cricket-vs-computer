# Hand Cricket vs Computer

This Python program allows you to play a game of hand cricket against the computer. The game involves both the player and the computer selecting random numbers between 1 and 6, calculating scores, and deciding the winner based on the toss and subsequent gameplay.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Odd or Even**: You start by choosing whether you want to play for odd or even numbers.
2. **Toss**: Enter a random number between 1 and 6. The computer will also select a random number. The sum of both numbers will determine if the result is odd or even, and the toss winner will be decided accordingly.
3. **Choose to Bat or Bowl**: If you win the toss, you get to choose whether you want to bat or bowl first. If the computer wins the toss, it will randomly choose to bat or bowl.
4. **Gameplay**:
    - **Batting**: Enter a number between 1 and 6. The computer will also select a number. If both numbers match, you are out, and your score is finalized. Otherwise, your score is incremented by the number you chose.
    - **Bowling**: Enter a number between 1 and 6. The computer will also select a number. If both numbers match, the computer is out, and its score is finalized. Otherwise, the computer's score is incremented by the number it chose.

The winner is determined by comparing the scores after both batting and bowling rounds.

## How to Run the Code

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the code to a file, for example, `hand_cricket.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5. Run the code using the command:
    python hand_cricket.py

Enjoy playing hand cricket against the computer!
